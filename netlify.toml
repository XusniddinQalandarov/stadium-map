  # Run a small script to generate `src/app/config/app.config.local.ts` from
  # Netlify environment variables (so secrets are not committed). The script
  # is safe to run even when env vars are empty â€” it will create a file with
  # empty placeholders which satisfies the TypeScript import during build.
